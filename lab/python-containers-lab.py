# Exercise 1
# Create a list named students containing some student names (strings).
# Print out the second student's name.
# Print out the last student's name.

students =['shaikha', 'sharifa', 'sumyh', 'hessa']
print(students[1])
 print(students[-1])

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise 2
# Create a tuple named foods containing the same number of foods (strings) as there are names in the students list.
# Use a for loop to print out the string "food goes here is a good food".

foods = ["Pizza", "Cheeseburger", "Salad", "Chicken"]
 for food in foods:
    print(f"{food} is a good food.") 

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 3
# Using a for loop, print just the last two food strings from foods.

# for food in foods[2:]:
#    print(f"{food} is a good food.") 
for food in foods[2:]:
   print(f"{food} is a good food.") 
   

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 4
# Create a dictionary named home_town containing the keys of city, state and population.
# Print a string with this format:
# "I was born in city, state - population of population"

home_town ={
    'city' : 'Arcadia',
    'state' : 'California',
    'population':58000,
}

 print(f"I was born in {home_town['city']}, {home_town['state']} - population of {home_town['population']} ")

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 5
# Iterate over the key: value pairs in home_town and print a string for each item, for example:
# "city = Arcadia"
# "state = California"
# "population = 58000"

 for key, val in home_town.items():
   print( f"{key} = {val}" )


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 6
# Create an empty list named cohort.
# Using a for loop, add one dictionary to the cohort list for each student name. Each dictionary should have this shape:
# {
#   'student': 'Tina',
#   'fav_food' 'Cheeseburger'
# }
# Iterate over cohort printing out each element.


cohort = []

for n in range(0,4):
   cohort_list = {
        'student': students[n],
        'fav_food': foods[n]
    }

for n in range(0,4):
   cohort_list = {
        'student': students[n],
        'fav_food': foods[n]
    }


   cohort.append(cohort_list)
 

for cohort_list in cohort:
  print(cohort_list)


   cohort.append(cohort_list)
 

for cohort_list in cohort:
  print(cohort_list)

# for awesome_list in awesome_students:
#  print(f"{awesome_list['student']} is awesome!" )

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 7
# Using the list of students and list comprehension, assign to a variable named awesome_students a new list containing strings similar to this:
# ["Tina is awesome!", "Fred is awesome!", "Wilma is awesome!"]
# Iterate over awesome_students printing out each string.

 awesome_students=[]

 for n in range(0,4):
    awesome_list = {
        'student': students[n],
     }

    awesome_students.append(awesome_list)

 for awesome_list in awesome_students:
   print(f"{awesome_list['student']} is awesome!" )


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 8
# Using the tuple foods and list comprehension within a for loop, print each food string that contains the letter a.

# food_list = [food for food in foods if 'a' in food]
# print(food_list)
food_list = [food for food in foods if 'a' in food]
print(food_list)
